Testrail Folder Descriptions:

A little background \- CMS and MAM have always been separate departments, applications, etc.  We joined as a team a couple years ago.  Now we’re creating an app called the “Unified App” that houses both the CMS and MAM applications in one.  

CMS \- Content Management System

* CMS Tab \- this really has no real meaning for being here tbh  
  * Editorial \- this is a tab in the Unified App to get to the CMS.  Editorial is where editors will create content (posts, authors, shows, etc)  
    * Posts \- This folder houses all our tests for Posts \- posts are articles that an editor would create and publish.  Editors can create/modify/delete posts  
      * Categories/Tags \- these are “types” of articles and content within the articles \- gives the end users a way to filter on content they want to actually read so to speak  
    * Person \- This folder houses all our tests related to people \- could be authors, news reporters, editors, etc.    
      * Editors could create/modify/delete persons within the application  
    * Pages \- This houses tests where an editor could create specific pages for specific events \- rather than a news article mixed in with everything else, it would be its own page  
      * Editors can create/modify/delete pages  
    * Aggregates \- This is hard to explain \- it’s a consolidated collection of content, data, or media gathered from multiple, often external, sources and presented in a single, unified location (thanks AI)  
      * Editors can create/modify/delete aggregates  
    * Shows \- This folder holds all our tests related to shows  
      * Editors can create/modify/delete shows  
    * Sources  
      * Sources are best described as the origin points, repositories, or raw material providers for digital assets and information.  
    * Media  
      * Houses all the images and video \- media assets \- that can be added to articles, etc.  
    * Plugins  
      * This has tests for different things like sending emails and what not \- it’s not ready in the Unified App yet
