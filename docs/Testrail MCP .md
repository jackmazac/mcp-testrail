1. Get access to Testrail  
2. Understand the differentiation between these folders  
3. Projects have different fields and details  
4. Human in the loop with verification/approval  
   1. Missing some domain knowledge

1. Now:  
   1. Making agent  
   2. Can make ticket, update ticket, update confluence, update automation tests   
2. Issue:  
   1. Was product for their team  
      1. Now wider team  
      2. More strict  
      3. Amount of work: linking test cases to Jira is time consuming  
      4. Need to adhere to strict standard  
      5. Extra 30-60 just to add to testrail  
         1. On per ticket basis  
3. Solution  
   1. Testrail MCP  
      1. Each MCP saves each member of team 30-60 minutes  
      2. Big time save  
   2. \+ Jira MCP

Get ticket → Find test suite in Testrail → Create test in correct suite → Link to Jira ticket  
Already using Jira MCP

Create a Cursor subagent with Jira MCP and Testrail MCP skills

**Need to figure out:**

1. Give knowledge of correct test suite  
   1. 50-100+ test suites

Types of Folders:
